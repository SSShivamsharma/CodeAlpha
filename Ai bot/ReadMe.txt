This is the readme of an AI chatbot which is done by using curl library (C++)
Thanks Git from where I downloaded the vcpkg package that help to run my program 

To run the program, make sure that you include
the curl library properly , and to link the curl library by -lcurl 
THis will help the program to link and run using curl ;library 

the file vcpkg is deleted before uploading on github because of the ig size of the file having more than 100 files in it , 
to use ai chatbot the vcpkg can be downloaded from the git 
and then Run the program 

Remember to use your open AI key in the code , i am removing my OpenAPI key 

from the above AI code . 

The API_Key looks like " Authorization: Bearer sk-proj-mlzI****nqOrB2Gy***************1qktQju50XY "

you can get this API_key from the "https://platform.openai.com/"
